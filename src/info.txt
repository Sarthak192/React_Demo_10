In the Person Component we define a function Component i.e Aux and in that we us e props.chilren and make the
root element as Aux and the alternative for this is we use <React.fragment>, in this we also make a higher 
order component that is which takes the class of the root componenet, in that we first makes a normal JS 
function that return functional component with two parameter the Wrapped Component and the class name.

In this when we use withClass in Person component and we not able to access the props as we accept input
WrappedComponent and print the WrappedComponent so we need the props to be available in WrappedComponent so
we makt he copy of props using spread operator.

Sometimes when we use setState, at that time we soometimes have to depend upon the old state or previous state
so in that case we have to set setState differently as a function and pass some parameter.

In this we can also validate our props by defining the props which we need and the type of that props.

If we want to focus on our input tag so if we use document.querySelector('input').focus() with 
componentDidMount() then it focus on the first input tag, so we have to use ref and the second method is by
using constructor() 

We can also use ref inside functional component using useRef it just do the same thing but we just have to
call it inside the useEffect but it ran just after render()

In this we pass props from cockpit to person so in order to transfer we just pass it to Persons which is 
not required hence we use some other technique.
