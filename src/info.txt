In this we just optimize our functional component using React.memo and what it ust it just improve the 
performance and we also use PureComponent concept in which we do not have to set shouldComponentUpdate() and
internally it compare all the prev props and the next props.

In this while we are in Person Component we delete the parent element and instead of that we use [] bracket
syntax separated by commas.
